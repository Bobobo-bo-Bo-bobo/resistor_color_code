Decode resistor color bands
===============================================

## Preface

The purpose of this tool is to decode the color bands found on resistors.

Color codes of resistors come in two "flavors": 4-band and 5-band. Both types are coded
by a number of colored bands around the resistor encodiing the resistance and the tolerance:
